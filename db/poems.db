--Turtle
Last night I saw a turtle;
It looked like a grenade.
I picked it up and threw it.
No explosion was made.
--Once 'upon' a time
Once upon a time,
There sat
A rather small,
Demented cat.
It choked upon a prawn
One night,
And toppled off the time
In fright.
--Flattened
The story that is told
By a severely flattened toad,
Is of evidential failure
In attempts to cross the road.
--Lamentation for the snail I accidentally stepped upon
Thou dost creep within the night;
Damp ground and air to aid thy flight.
The darkness keepeth thee from sight
While on my lettuce thou dost bite
And drape with slime.
But thou hast crept too stealthily;
And was not this the death of thee?
For though it was too dark to see,
A noise could have prevented me
From crushing thee last night.
--Wasp
O wasp upon my window sill,
How dull thy once dread sting!
Thy presence brought foreboding
Of the pain that thou couldst bring;
And this caused me to cudgel thee,
Thou wretched, wretched thing.
--Behind
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Something is standing
Right behind you. 
--I Know It's Over
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
--Little Willie
 Little Willie, full of gore
Nailed his sister to the floor.
Willie's always up to tricks.
Ain't he cute?
He's only six.
--Call of the Kindered
Come to me, little mortal
I can bring you to heaven's portal
There'll be no sorrow, there'll be no pain
Feelings of joy will fill your brain.
Come to me, sweet human thing
Give me your heart and I'll make it sing
Forget your fears, leave them behind
Forget the troubles of your kind.
Come to me... yes, that's right
Now hold still, it's no good to fight
I'll take your blood, and leave you dying
Didn't you realise I could be lying?
